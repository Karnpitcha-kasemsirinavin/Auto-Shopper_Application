Problem for idea: Normally, when people shop in the supermarket, they don't make a list of items or calculate the total cost beforehand. This lead to forgetting necessity items and over budget.

What is Auto-Shopper(Model)?: It is a project of smart cart which use in a supermarket that let the user use RFID scanner in adding items into the cart or removing items from the cart and show the number and total cost of the items in the cart in a mobile application. 
The data from will be uploaded to firebase when the user scan an item ,then the application fetch the data from firebase and update it real-time.

On the main screen of the application, there is a list of items that present in the cart. Each box represent different item. On the left-most side of the box, there is a color indicate the catergory of the item. Next is the picture and a name of the item and following with the amount of the item that currently in the cart. On the right-most, it showing a price of the item. The total cost of items can be seen at the bottom of the screen and next to it is a button that would lead to the next screen after the user finish shopping.

***This application is a prototype. It can be used by one person at a time.***
 This project was developed during Nov - Dec 2022 as a part of PCA course.
